<h1>Rapyd Library at a Glance</h1>

<h2>Cruds in few minuts</h2>
<p>If you like Code Igniter, but you need to boost your development
(at least for backends) Rapyd Library is a good choise. Its goal is to
enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were
writing code from scratch, and to leave you decide when is time to use
classic mvc approach, or to build a complete and complex crud in 10 line
of code in few minutes directly in a controller without models or views.
His syntax is concise, easy to be mantained.


<h2>Rapyd is Open Source</h2>
<p>Rapyd Library is licensed under LGPL open source license so you
can use it however you please.


<h2>Rapyd Runs on PHP 4</h2>
<p>Rapyd is written to be compatible with PHP 4.</p>
<p>Note: Rapyd Library will run on PHP 5. It simply does not take
advantage of any native features that are only available in that
version.</p>

<h2>Rapyd is Light Weight</h2>
<p>The core system requires only a few very small libraries. It has
the same philosophy of CI, components are loaded dynamically upon
request (as CI libraries). Based on your needs for a given process, so
the base system is very lean and quite fast.</p>
<p>It include TinyMCE that has a lot of files, but is really the
better and smaller wysiwyg replacement for textareas used by most of cms
(wordpress, drupal, joobla, etc.)


<h2>Rapyd Generates Clean URLs</h2>
<p>components generated urls are semantic, clean and search-engine
friendly:</p>
<code> www.your-site.com/controller/function/<dfn>orderby</dfn>/<kbd>userid</kbd>/<samp>desc</samp>
<br />
www.your-site.com/controller/function/<dfn>search_uri</dfn>/<kbd>name</kbd>/<samp>jhonny</samp>
</code>


<h2>Component Based approach</h2>
<p>With rapyd you can think/develop by "components". So, if you need
to build a "filtered grid"<br />
<p>instead of:<br />
- <kbd>" I will develop my model.. create my custom sql, iterate
my custom view, sniff Post, intercept actions.."</kbd><br />
you can think:<br />
- <dfn>" I need a DataFilter joined with a DataGrid."</dfn></p>

<h2>Rapyd is Extensible</h2>
<p>Rapyd can be easily extended by creating new components/classes,
using the loader class: <code> //in controllers/models<br />
<br />
$rapyd->load->("mywidget");<br />
<br />
<br />
//you can access ci &amp; rapyd from your classes<br />
<br />
class myWidget {<br />
..<br />
function myWidget()<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;..<br />
&nbsp;$this->ci =&amp; get_instance();<br />
&nbsp;$this->rapyd =&amp; $this->ci->rapyd;<br />
}<br />
..<br />
}<br />
</code></p>


<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>Rapyd has a theme system which is thought to standardize
components layout.<br />
It comes with a "default" folder theme, but you can build your custom
theme in few minutes.<br />
</p>


<h2>Rapyd has a Friendly Community of Users</h2>
