<h1>Themes-Views and Themes-Design</h1>

<p>The theme system of rapyd is thought to standardize components
layout.</p>
<p>Since the 0.9.8 version each rapyd Theme has its own Design. So
all the rapyd layout is switchable; Components Views, Images, and CSS. <br />
This new layout systeme also support a shared Design, it is a Design in
witch you can put all design content (images ans css) that need to be
share by more than one Theme. Rapyd first search the design element in
the current Theme-Design content and if it doesn't find it, it will
search into the shared Design.</p>
<h2>The Structure :</h2>
<p>The system use two differents directory structure, One for the
components templates php files( the Theme-views directories) and one for
the design files: images and css (the Theme-design directories).</p>
<p><strong>Theme-views structure:</strong> <br />
This feature is unchanged all the Theme components views folder are in <dfn>application/rapyd/view</dfn>
directory. It's a container of CI views (so you must use php instead
placeholders). The folder name define the Theme name, so <dfn>application/rapyd/view/default</dfn>
directory is the <dfn>&quot;default&quot;</dfn> Theme.<br />
Each (template-based) component need a view in each Theme views folder.
So you can build your custom theme by copying and renaming the default
folder theme and customise the view files.</p>
<p><strong>Theme-design structure:</strong><br />
All Theme-desgin contents are into the design-elements directory, the
path to this directory is explain in the next config notes. So each
Theme need a folder into the design-elements directory named with the
Theme name (same name as the Theme-views folder) and optionaly one more
folder for the shared Theme-desgin that doesn't need to match with a
Theme-views folder name, they are the Theme-design folder. Each
theme-design folder need two subfolders one for the images and the other
for the Css, by default these subfolders names are &quot;css&quot; and
&quot;images&quot; but you can change it into the config. <br />
So if you build a custom Theme-views You need to buid a matching
Theme-design, it could be empty or not complete and use an other
Theme-design as Shared or a modificated content of the default one.Don't
forgot that the rapyd base content have to keep original names for
files(images and css).</p>
<h2>The Config :</h2>
<p>You can manage the rapyd Theme system with some properties from <dfn>/system/application/config/rapyd.php</dfn>
config file.</p>
<p><strong>The Rapyd default Theme:</strong> <span class="Style1">$rpd['theme']
= 'default'; </span><br />
This config define the default Rapyd current Theme. You have to put a
valide Theme folder name (remember same folder name for the Theme-views
and Theme-design folder).</p>
<p>But it's also possible to change the Rapyd current Theme at
"runtime": <br />
<textarea name="code" class="php:nogutter" rows="2" cols="100">

$this->load->library("rapyd");
$this->rapyd->config->set_item("theme","newtheme"); 

</textarea> <br />
Tipically the runtime changement of theme enable using of different
themes for "backend/frontend" or different sections of frontend.</p>
<p><strong>The Theme design-elements directory path:</strong><span
	class="Style1"> $rpd['design_elements_path'] =&quot;&quot;;</span><br />
This config define the path to the design-elements directory (in witch
we have the theme-design folders). If you leave it empty rapyd use the
default path '/application/rapyd/elements'.<br />
If you decide to move this directory there is one restriction, your new
directory will have to be every where but into the Server Document Root
($_SERVER[&quot;DOCUMENT_ROOT&quot;]). And the path you set have to be
from this $_SERVER[&quot;DOCUMENT_ROOT&quot;] like this:
&quot;www/root_site1/content/rapyd_elements&quot; =&gt;
$rpd['design_elements_path']
=&quot;/root_site1/content/rapyd_elements/&quot;; (if www is you
$_SERVER[&quot;DOCUMENT_ROOT&quot;]).<br />
For the moment Rapyd doesn't support a design_elements_path outside of
the DOCUMENT_ROOT even if you use an apache alias config on it. So if
you move Your CI 'application' folder outside of the DOCUMENT_ROOT
(thats work with rapyd) you will need to keep your <strong>design-elements
directory</strong> into the DOCUMENT_ROOT and use this config to set the right
path.</p>
<p><strong>The Theme-design content subfolder name:</strong> <span
	class="Style1">$rpd['assets_type_folder_name'] =array('css'
=&gt; 'css','image'=&gt;'images'); </span><br />
As it's explained in the structure notes, <strong>design-elements
directory </strong>has two subfolder for css and images contents. We can control
this subfolders names with this config var. <br />
You can change the default folder name in something like this: <span
	class="Style2">$rpd['assets_type_folder_name'] =array('css'
=&gt; 'new_css_folder_name','image'=&gt;'new_images_folder_name');<br />
</span>Don't forgot that all <strong>Theme-design</strong> <strong>content
subfolder</strong>have to follow the same naming.</p>
<p><strong>The Shared Theme-design</strong>: <span class="Style1">$rpd['shared_theme_design']='default';</span><br />
This config allow you to define the shared design in witch Rapyd will
search the content file if it doesn't find it in the current
Theme-design. As you can see the default shared design could be an
existing Theme design it is why we say that creating a special design
for shared content is optionaly, but seting the shared design is not
optionaly.<br />
In the default rapyd config files the system use the &quot;default&quot;
Theme design content as shared Theme, So 'default' Theme design content
is used for the 'default' Theme and for all other Theme missing files.</p>
<p>it's also possible to change the current Shared Design at
&quot;runtime&quot;: <br />
<textarea name="code" class="php:nogutter" rows="2" cols="100">
	$this->rapyd->config->set_item("shared_theme_design","new_design-theme");  
	
    </textarea> <br />
Tipically the runtime changement of Shared Design enable using of
different Theme-design content in replacement of the current one missing
content. So each design content could be a shared design and also you
can have more than one Theme-design folder that doesn't match with a
Theme-view folder but only usable as shared design.</p>
<h2>Advanced Work</h2>
<p>When you work on Theme You first create or modify the components
views that use the design content then if you want additional design
content to be output in your views, you can put the files (tipically
images) into your Theme-design and output it into your view with the
following function that return the right path according to the current
Theme.</p>
<p><textarea name="code" class="php:nogutter" rows="2" cols="100">
	$img_src = $this->rapyd->get_elements_path("file_name","image");  
	
    </textarea> <br />
The &quot;file_name&quot; should be the file name if the file is into'
elements/design_name/images' folder or a path from this folder to the
file: if the file is ' elements/design_name/images/img1/test.jpg' =&gt;
file_name =&quot;img1/test.jpg&quot;.</p>
<p>You can also use the function get_elements_path(); to find
additional css file path using the Theme system into your code. You
build the css file path according to the current Theme using this
function with the 'css' argument.</p>
<p><textarea name="code" class="php:nogutter" rows="2" cols="100">
  $css_src = $this->rapyd->get_elements_path("file_name","css");
  //other stuff
  $this->rapyd->css[]=$css_src;
  </textarea> <br />
The second line is an additional stuff that you should use if you want
that the css file will be output in the header using the
rapyd-&gt;get_head() function.</p>
